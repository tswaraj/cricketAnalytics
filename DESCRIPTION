Description: Our project aims to create a data pipeline for predicting the outcome of Women’s T20 Challenge cricket matches using ball-by-ball CSV data available on the cricsheet.org website. The project’s objective is to develop a data pipeline that extracts useful features from the CSV data and transforms it into a tabular format suitable for creating visualizations and building a ML model.
